## About This Project:

Our application, Medicus HDS (“medicus” is Latin for “physician”), is a hospital database meant for a single hospital or clinic’s staff to manage hospital records. This database is used to track patient data, employee data, medical equipment data, medicine data, and medical operations data. 
 
The database system is essential because it provides a central point for data to be accessed by all hospital employees, and allows for the management of a large set of data. The database system also allows access control for sensitive medical or personal information to be enforced. It is easier to manage this than paper records, as entering information into the system guarantees that required fields are recorded, and it is more easily queried. It assists medical staff in their duties by allowing them to quickly access information about patients, medicines, etc. 
 
Example uses of the hospital database include retrieving information about a patient or hospital employee, scheduling medical operations, and tracking inventory of medicines. 

The SQL code may be run using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
